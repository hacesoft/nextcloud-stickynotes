## Requirements

- Nextcloud 35 and PHP 8.3 or newer.
- **[Hacesoft Core](https://github.com/hacesoft/core), version 0.18.0-dev.2 or newer, installed and enabled.** Sticky Notes requires Core to function.

Core is a separate application; it is not bundled with Sticky Notes. Install it first using the instructions in the [Core repository](https://github.com/hacesoft/core).

## Installation and updates

Download and extract the complete source package. From the extracted project root, run:

```sh
sudo sh install.sh
```

The installer supports the documented Synology/Docker deployment. Read the [installation guide](docs/en/INSTALL.md) for prerequisites and upgrade instructions. Existing notes remain in the database during upgrades. Before updating, back up the database and application files.

To uninstall, read the removal section in the installation guide and use `sudo sh uninstall.sh` from the project root. Review the script's options before removing stored data.

## Source layout

`src/` contains the application runtime, `scripts/` installation helpers and `docs/cz/` and `docs/en/` Czech and English documentation. `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` are included in the full source package. `build-release.sh` builds runtime ZIP/tarball artifacts from `src/`; generated output belongs in `release/`.

Maintainer information: [development](docs/en/DEVELOPMENT.md), [Nextcloud 35 review](docs/en/NC35_REVIEW_EN.md) and [changelog](docs/en/CHANGELOG.md).

License: [AGPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE).

## Languages

The application UI supports all 11 languages: Czech (`cs`), English (`en`), German (`de`), Spanish (`es`), French (`fr`), Italian (`it`), Dutch (`nl`), Polish (`pl`), Portuguese (`pt`), Slovak (`sk`) and Ukrainian (`uk`). Unsupported languages and individual missing translations fall back to English (EN). Every catalog has the same complete key set and preserves message placeholders. Text returned directly by the server or Core components follows those services’ localization. Guides and development documentation are available only in Czech and English.

Every future app update must audit the shared language set: `cs`, `en`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `nl`, `pl`, `pt`, `sk`, `uk`. Add missing languages and translation keys, verify Nextcloud language selection, and document the languages actually supported. A catalog file alone does not prove translation completeness. User guides and development documentation are published only in Czech and English.

Translation audit for future releases (Python 3 and Node.js):

```sh
python3 scripts/check-languages.py
```
